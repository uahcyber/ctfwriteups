## Walkthrough: 

This challenge confused me at first because, unlike the majority of the other challenges, nothing was linked. After solving some other challenges, I realized that this is probably some sort of OSINT challenge. A simple google search of the challenge name takes us to the challenge author’s YouTube channel:

Some searching around and we find an interesting string in the About section:

Lets throw that in CyberChef and Hex decode it:

“middlepart”, interesting.. 

At first I thought this might be referring to the middle part of a video or maybe the middle video in the channel history? Nope. It admittedly took me way too long to connect the challenge description with the solution: “Warm socks and warm wine, so the caption said.” Let’s see if there’s any videos with captions!

YouTube kindly shows us that there’s only two videos on his channel with captions enabled. You could go through both videos and find the captions, but surely there’s a better way? My teammate [dayt0n] (https://github.com/dayt0n), suggested I take a look at a program called youtube-dl, which worked perfectly. 

Using youtube-dl we can download all subtitles/captions: 

`youtube-dl --all-subs --skip-download [video link]`

Opening up the two files generated by youtube-dl we reveal the remaining parts of the flag:

Combining everything with the “middlepart” string we get the flag, nice!
